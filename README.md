'exported_CSV' folder - folder containing the exported csv which is exported from the 2nd python code 'part_2_mars_weather'
1. 'part_1_mars_news' - first part of the python code which is scalping the website by extracting the text elements (which is shown through pressing F12)
2. 'part_2_mars_weathers' - second part of the python code which is scalping the website containing a table data, used the raw table to display various graphs. At the end of the script, it
